I plan to use this blog to share my experiences with information security related subjects.

I am OSCP certified. Fascinated with hacking, malware, phishing, and red teaming.

Interested in all things hacking. Constantly exploring new vectors and experimenting with interesting tools.

Hire me? Wanna say hello or share a new tool?
